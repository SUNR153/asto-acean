    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      Our team is a group of six curious minds who love turning ideas into something bright and meaningful. Two clever front-end developers build interactive worlds where imagination comes alive. Our artist fills them with color, feeling, and personality. The manager keeps us organized and moving forward. And two members with deep knowledge of the Earth help us understand how cosmic weather affects our planet — bridging science and creativity. Together, we’re creating a children’s comic about cosmic weather, where space adventures meet real science, inspiring young readers to explore the wonders of the universe and our place within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to make creative stories accessible to everyone — regardless of ability or background.
